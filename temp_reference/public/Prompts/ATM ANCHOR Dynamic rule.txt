CRITICAL: ATM MUST NOT BE MANUALLY PROVIDED.

ATM must be computed automatically by the system using live prices.

ATM COMPUTATION RULE:
• Fetch underlying LTP (index, stock, commodity)
• Read strike interval from instrument master
• Compute:
  ATM = round(LTP / strike_interval) * strike_interval

ATM sources:
• At system startup: use Market Quote REST (batched) OR first WebSocket tick
• During live market: update ATM logically from WebSocket ticks

STRIKE GENERATION RULE:
• Strikes must be generated ONLY AFTER ATM is computed
• Do NOT sort strikes lexicographically
• Do NOT pick lowest or first strike
• All strike selection must be relative to ATM

DYNAMIC ATM BEHAVIOR:
• ATM may update in real time for display & logic
• Strike subscriptions MUST remain FIXED intraday
• Re-subscription allowed ONLY on:
  - Market open
  - Expiry rollover
  - Explicit ADMIN refresh
• Never resubscribe strikes on every price move

If ATM cannot be computed (no price available):
• Abort strike generation
• Log error
• Do NOT guess ATM
