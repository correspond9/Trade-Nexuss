1. **Update** **`authoritative_option_chain_service.py`:**

   * Locate the loop in `_get_or_fetch_live_data` where `ce_ltp` and `pe_ltp` are extracted.

   * Add fallback logic: if `ltp` is 0, check `close`, `prev_close`, `previous_close`.

   * Also check inside nested `ohlc` object if available.
2. **Restart Backend:**

   * Stop the current backend process.

   * Start it again to apply changes.
3. **Verify:**

   * Check the Option Chain page in the frontend to see if prices appear.

   * Verify the Expiry dates and Lot sizes are accurate are are only fetched from REST API and not from the locally saved  instrument\_master.csv (or similar name)

   * Intellegently note the LTP of the 3 oprion chains NIFYT, BANKNIFTY and SENSEX and verify that the list fetched and display is as per the calculations of ATM 
4. Cautio**n:**

   * Make sure tocompile with the Dhan rate limitations to not get IP Blocked.
   * Rate limiter can be found in the root directory for reference.
