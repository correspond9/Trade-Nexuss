You are working on a production-grade low-latency trading and brokerage infrastructure.

Always maintain deep awareness of the full repository structure, execution flow, websocket data flow, and order lifecycle.

Before suggesting or writing changes:
- analyze system-wide impact
- preserve stability and latency
- avoid breaking execution flow
- ensure compatibility with existing architecture

Assume this system will handle real money and many users, so reliability and safety are critical.
